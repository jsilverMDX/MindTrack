<h1>our story</h1>

<p>Mindynamics was born shortly after the beginning of 2010 when keyvan and jsilver joined forces because they knew that they would make a great team. And we think that we have been very correct!</p>

<p>After working together for some time, we found out that we actually did work very well together and we have grown our skills an amazing amount.</p>

<p>And we have been able to grow the team a couple members as well, and to start sharing our knowledge with these new members, which has been an amazing experience, teaching.</p>

<p>Mindynamics is our dreamchild prodigy based on how we roll: webcollaboration.</p>
